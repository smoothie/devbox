### TODO

- [ ] Consider (ADR) splitting groups into devmachine, devcontroller:
  - The machine would be the current webserver stuff (virtual machine managed via vagrant).
  - The controller would be the host. So stuff like PHPStorm, browsers and so could be installed.
- [ ] k0s: 
  - Update kubectl auth when installing k0s.
  - Consider (ADR) extracting deployments into separate roles, maybe per use case e.g. one for ingress-nginx, another one for metallb, another one for k0sctl.
- [ ] bash completions: Add a role which lets us add bash completions and computes enabled CLI's into that one. 
- [ ] Support self-signed apache2 vhosts
- [ ] Fix apache2, php, user permissions
    - Context: Currently we rewrite apache, php user to vagrant:vagrant.  
      This is considered a bad practice, that's why we should do something else (TBD).
