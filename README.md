## Project Description

As a web developer, I know the importance of a smooth local development environment. That's why 
I created smoothie's Devbox—an Ansible playbook that does the heavy lifting for me... and maybe 
for you too.

- [x] **Streamlined Project Organization:** Dedicated vendor folder for each client, ensuring a 
  well-organized and clean structure.
- [x] **Simple Environment Setup:** No fuss, no stress – just smooth sailing!

### TODO

- [x] Fix Xdebug config for Xdebug 2 (php: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1).
    - Fixed: Add missing php5.6-xdebug packages on defaults :facepalm:
- [ ] Extract common:git into separate role
    - [ ] Set defaults (git user, mail, global gitignore, default branch name)
    - git config --global init.defaultBranch
- [ ] Support self-signed apache2 vhosts
- [ ] Fix apache2, php, user permissions
    - Context: Currently we rewrite apache, php user to vagrant:vagrant.  
      This is considered a bad practice, that's why we should do something else (TBD).
