# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with

# Here is entries for some specific programs
# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram

[mysqld]
#
# * Basic Settings
#
user = {{ mysql_system_user }}
port = {{ mysql_port }}
datadir	= {{ mysql_data_directory }}


# If MySQL is running as a replication slave, this should be
# changed. Ref https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_tmpdir
# tmpdir = /tmp
#
# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.

mysqlx-bind-address = {{ mysql_bind_address_mysqlx }}

#
# * Fine Tuning
#
key_buffer_size = {{ mysql_key_buffer_size }}
max_allowed_packet = {{ mysql_max_allowed_packet }}
thread_stack = {{ mysql_thread_stack }}

# thread_cache_size = -1

# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched

# table_open_cache = 4000

#
# * Logging and Replication
#
# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
#
# Log all queries
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/query.log
# general_log = 1
#
# Error log - should be very few entries.
#
log_error = {{ mysql_log_error }}

# slow_query_log = 1
# slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
# long_query_time = 2
# log-queries-not-using-indexes
#
# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.
